## ch03 sentence structure

When the word _that_ appears just after a working verb, a new subject—verb—object structure will follow. (the word _that_ can also serve other roles)

Technically, the missing _that_ (acceptable in real world) can make the sentence ambiguous.

```txt
I know xx is an actor.
```

Do u actually know xx herself? Or do u know something about xx?

---

Two complete sentences can be connected using a comma plus a conjunction to create a **compound sentence**. Some very common conjunctions are: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so. (FANBOYS)

You can also connect two independent clauses using a semicolon. The `;` connects two closely related statements.

The semicolon is often followed by a transition expression, such as _however_, _therefore_, or _in addition_. These transitional elements are not true conjunctions. As a result, u must use semicolons to join the sentences.

## ch04 modifiers

An adjective modifies only a noun or a pronoun, whereas an adverb modifies almost anything but a noun or a pronoun.

Which of these sentences is more logical?

```txt
Max's grandma is his supposed Irish ancestor
Max's grandma is his supposedly Irish ancestor
```

### noun modifier

The "comma which" structure is an example of **nonessential modifier**.

When u can ask a _who_, _what_, _which_, or _where_ question about a noun, and the answer points to the modifier, u have a noun modifier.

- Sue placed the CAT on the couch

Where is the cat? (on the couch)

Place a noun and its modifier as close together as possible.

_Where_ cannot modify a "metaphorical" place, such as _condition_, _situation_, _case_, _circumstance_, or _arrangement_. In these cases, use _in which_:

- "We had an arrangement IN WHICH he cooked and i cleaned".

### [adverbial](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Adverbial) modifier

> In grammar, an **adverbial** (abbreviated ADV) is a word or a group of words that modifies or more closely defines the sentence of the verb.

Adverbial modifiers also answer questions, such as how, when, where, or why an action occurred.

- "Exhausted from her job, she bought a lottery ticket with hopes of winning big"

You could think of _exhausted from her job_ as a noun modifier of _she_. However, the context of the rest of the sentence matters. It is better to think of this modifier as applicable to the whole main clause.

---

- Although the economy is strong, the retail industry is struggling.

The first part of the sentence is called a **subordinate clause**. It has a subordinator at the beginning; it is _not_ complete sentence.

Common subordinators are: although, before, unless, because, that, so that, if, yet, after, while, since, when.

Use only one connecting word per "connection".

A common wrong sentence in speech:

- Crime has recently decreased in out neighborhood, WHICH has led to a rise in property value.

Remember the rule: use WHICH _only_ to refer to nouns—never to refer to an entire clause.

---

- GREAT courage
- AMOUNT of furniture

_enough_ and _all_ work with both countable and uncountable nouns.

Do not use the word _less_ with countable items. This error has become common in speech.

Be careful with unit nouns, such as _dollars_ or _gallons_. By their nature, unit noun are countable; however, they represent uncountable quantities: _money_, _volume_. As a result, use _less_ with unit nouns, when you really want to indicate something about the underlying quantity:

- We have less than 13 DOLLARS

## ch05 parallelism

Parallelism markers can be **open**, with a word or words between the two parallel elements, or **closed**, with a word or words between the two elements as well as before the first element. For example:

- open
  - and, or, rather than
- closed
  - both/and, either/or, not/but, not only/but also, from/to

People often mistakenly use parallelism when no markers is present or without regard for the meaning of the sentence.

The **linking verbs** are parallelism markers.

## ch06 comparisons

Comparisons are a subset of parallelism.

A comparison can also use a pronoun to stand in for the noun first mentioned.

- Frank's build, like that of his brother, is broad and muscular.

Some common comparison markers:

- like (X, like Y / like X, Y)
- unlike
- as: "A is smart, AS is B"
- than: "You have earned a better score THAN I have"
- as (adjective) as: "Mira is AS likely AS Sam to win the promotion."
- different from: "My current job is quite DIFFERENT FROM my last one."
- in contrast to/with.

You can omit words (units, verbs, and even whole clauses) from the second term, as long as there is no ambiguity in the comparison:

- A's * is bigger than B's.
- Whereas I drink two quarts of milk a day, my friend drinks three[quarts of milk a day].
- I walk faster than B[walks ].
- I walk as fast now as[I walked] when I was younger.

In general, include the omitted words or appropriate helping verbs if the sentence would otherwise be ambiguity. E.g., "I like milk more than K" ???

- I like milk more than K DOES. (more than K likes milk)
- I like milk more than I DO K. (more than I likes milk)

_Like_ is used to compare nouns, pronouns, or noun phrases.

~~LIKE~~ AS her brother DID, Ava aced the test.

## ch07 pronouns

A pronoun is a word that takes the place of a noun, so that you do not have to repeat that noun elsewhere in the sentence.

In grammar, an antecedent (\ˌan-tə-ˈsē-dənt\) is an expression (word, phrase, clause, sentence, etc.) that gives its meaning to a proform (pronoun, pro-verb, pro-adverb).

- John arrived late because traffic held him up.

The pronoun _him_ refers to and takes its meaning from _John_, so _John_ is the **antecedent** of _him_

Repeat the noun if any new copy _that_ or _those_ does not agree in number.

- Her COMPANY is outperforming the companies ~~those~~ of her competitors.

## ch08 verbs

The **verb tense** of a working verb indicates when the action of the verb takes place.

Past Perfect = HAD + Past Participle

- By 1945, the United States HAD BEEN at war for several years

The word _before_ indicates the sequence of events clearly; it is not necessary to use past perfect to convey the proper meaning.

- Laura LOCKED the deadbolt before she LEFT for work

The **present perfect** tense is used for actions that started in the past but continue into the present, or remain true in the present.

- They HAVE KNOWN each other since 1987.

The **conditional tense** is formed by combining _would_ with the base form of the verb. This construction expresses the future from the point of view of the past.

- The scientist BELIEVED that the machine WOULD BE wonderful.

Metaphorically, _voice_ can also mean the way people express themselves.

Passive voice has a reputation for sounding awkward.

## ch09 idioms

EMPTY

## ch10 structure and modifiers (extra)

The colon (:) provides further explanation for what comes before it. Whatever needs explanation should be placed as close to the colon as possible.

The dash (—) is a flexible punctuation mark. U can use a dash as an emphatic comma, semicolon, or colon.

A **collective noun** is a noun that looks singular but can refer to a group of people or objects. In AmE, such nouns are considered singular, though in BrE, they are considered plural.

An **indefinite pronoun** is not specific about the thing to which it refers. _Anyone_ is an example of an indefinite pronoun. All the pronouns that end in _-one_, _-body_, _-thing_ are considered singular and require singular verb forms. (each, every; either, neither may require a plural verb if paired with or/nor)

There are, however, five indefinite pronouns that can be either singular or plural depending on the context of the sentence. U can remember these five by the acronym SANAM: some, any, none, all, more/most

> When in doubt, think singular.

The GMAT does not like _this_ or _that_ by themselves, since these pronouns have vague antecedents unless they are attached to a noun (e.g., _these results_)

## ch11 parallelism and comparisons (extra)

The GMAT will not make simple gerund phrases (phrases do not have an article at the beginning of the phrase) parallel to complex ones.

In certain circumstances, adjectives can be parallel to present or past participles:

- Only a few feet wide BUT spanning a continent, the railroad changed history.
- A mastodon carcass, thawed only once AND still fresh, is on display.

_Thawed_ and _fresh_ both function as adjectives to modify a noun.

The word _as_ can be either a conjunction or a preposition, depending on the context:

- _Conjunction as_: appears with a clause and has three uses:
  1. Duration: As I strolled to the store, I smelled the air.
  2. Causation: I will not tell you, as u already know.
  3. Comparison: You should walk as she wants you to walk.

- _Preposition as_:
  1. Function: As your leader, I am in charge.
  2. Equation: I think you as my friend.
  3. Stage: As a child, I thought I could fly.

Use _times_ and _as...as_ together to relate the quantities by multiplication:

- The man is FIVE TIMES AS OLD AS his grandson. (the man's age is equal to 5 x his grandson's age)

Use _times_ without _as_ or _than_ to indicate direct multiplication:

- The cost of a ticket is ¥12, SIX TIMES the cost ten years ago.
- The concert was attended by 300 people, TWICE the previous attendance.

The word _more_ and _less_ are rather flexible:

- I own MORE THAN I should. (noun or pronoun)
- I own MORE SHIRTS THAN I should. (adjective)
- I sleep MORE THAN I should. (adverb)

## ch12 pronouns and verbs (extra)

The **reflexive pronouns** _itself_ and _themselves_ are used as objects to refer directly back the subject.

The **reciprocal pronouns** _one another_ and _each other_ are used to indicate interaction between parties.

The words _such_ and _other/another_ often combine with a general noun to indicate an antecedent. _Such_ means "like the antecedent."; _other_ and _another_ mean "additional thing of the same type," thought not necessarily "exactly alike"

- Quinn did not eat dinner quickly, but her brother did so.

Technically, _do so_ is called a "pro-verb," since it stands for a verb or even an entire predicate.

Some sentences use what is called a **placeholder it**, aka a **dummy pronoun**.

Progressive tenses emphasizes the ongoing nature of an action.

### If then constructions

Sentences with an _if_ condition and a _then_ outcome can follow serval tense/mood patterns:

1. General Rule with Certainty
    - If K EATS pizza, THEN he BECOMES ill.
    - (equivalent to) WHENEVER K eats pizza, he BECOMES ill.
2. General Rule with Some Uncertainty
    - If K EATS pizza, THEN he MAY BECOME ill.
3. Particular Case with Certainty
    - (in the future) If K EATS pizza tomorrow, THEN he WILL BECOME ill.
    - (in the present) If K HAS EATEN pizza, THEN he WILL BECOME ill.
4. Unlikely Case (in the future)
    - If K ATE pizza tomorrow, THEN he WOULD BECOME ill.
    - If K WERE TO pizza, THEN he WOULD BECOME ill.
5. Case That Never Happened (in the past)
    - If K HAD EATEN pizza yesterday, THEN he WOULD HAVE BECOME ill. (conditional perfect)

In the case 4, the writer thinks that K is unlikely to eat pizza tomorrow. The _if_ part contains a _hypothetical subjunctive_. For _to be_, always use _were_, not _was_.

To form the conditional perfect, use _would have_ + _past participle_.

The helping verbs _would_ and _should_ should NEVER go in the _if_ part of the sentence, according to the GMAT.

### The Command Subjunctive

The command subjunctive is used with certain bossy verbs, such as _require_ or _propose_.

The subjunctive construction with a bossy verb is always as follows:

- bossy verb + _THAT_ + subject + Command Subjunctive

With some of the most common bossy verbs, such as _want_, you must use an infinitive (_to_ + the bare form).

Memorize the idiom:

- verbs that take ONLY the command subjunctive when indicating desire: demand, dictate, insist, mandate, propose, recommend, request, stipulate, suggest
- verbs that take ONLY the infinitive: advise, allow, forbid, persuade, want
- verbs that take either . or .: ask, beg, intend, order, prefer, urge, _require_

A few bossy verbs, most notably _prohibit_, take other constructions altogether:

- The agency PROHIBITED K FROM WORKING on weekends.

The command subjunctive can also be used with nouns derived from bossy verbs, such as _a demand_ or _a request_:

- His demand THAT he BE paid full severance was not met.

Btw, a few bossy verbs can be used in non-bossy ways: _His presence suggests that he is happy._ In this context, _suggests_ means "probably means".

### Helping Verbs

The three primary helping verbs are **_BE_**, **_DO_**, and **_HAVE_**. The verb _be_ generates the progressive tenses and passive voice, while _have_ generates the perfect tenses. _Do_ is used with simple present or past to negate verbs (_I DO not like eggs_), emphasize verbs (_He DOES like eggs_), or ask questions.

There are several **modal helping verbs**: can, could, may, might, must ,shall, should, will, and would.

Think of _modal_ as relating to some "mode," or form. A modal verb is a helper that gives additional information about the verb that follows it.

## others

A relative clause is a clause headed by a relative pronoun:

- The man who is cleaning the steps is Mr.A

Absolute phrases are composed of a noun plus a noun modifier. These phrases do not have to modify what they touch; rather, they modify the main clause in some way. E.g.:

- His head held high, Owen walked out of the store.

The [subjunctive](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/subjunctive) is a verb mood that expresses a possibility and is often used for wished, desired, or possible (but not definite) states of being. Subjunctive phrases often begin with the words, "If I were..."

fragments:

- a clause contains a working verb, one that can be the main verb in a sentence
- action noun: eruption, the escape
- gerund: the rising
- working verb
- The _infinitive_ form of the verb is its most basic form, usually its "to" version. The verb is not limited or bounded by its subject or tense. (The word _infinitive_ comes from the Latin _infinitus_ meaning "unbounded, unlimited.")
- participle: yelling, fatigued
- preposition
- linking verb: _to be_ (is, were, be), appear, become, grow, remain, represent, stay, turn, resemble, feel, taste, look, sound, seem
- apostrophe
- [ain't](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ain%27t)
- noun-adjective
- article (_a_ or _the_)
- the term **verbals** refer to verb forms used as adjectives, adverbs, or nouns.
