- **architecture**: The overall design or structure of a computer system, including the hardware and the software required to run it, especially the internal structure of the microprocessor.

- **archive**: A file containing one or more files in compressed format for more efficient storage and transfer.

- **batch**: A set of data or jobs to be processed in a single program run.

- **bitmap**: A set of bits that represents a graphic image, with each bit or group of bits corresponding to a pixel in the image.

- **build**: Any of various versions of a software product as it is being developed for release to users.

- **client**: A computer or program that can download files for manipulation, run applications, or request application-based services from a file server.

- In computing, a **compiler** is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another language (the target language). The name "compiler" is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language (e.g., assembly language, object code, or machine code) to create an executable program. - from Wikipedia

- **cursor**: A bright, usually blinking, movable indicator on a display, marking the position at which a character can be entered, corrected, or deleted.

- **daemon**: A program or process that sits idly in the background until it is invoked to perform its task. (runs as a background process, rather than being under control of an interactive user - from Wikipedia)

- A **decompiler** is a computer program that takes an executable file as input, and attempts to create a high level source file which can be recompiled successfully. It is usually unable to perfectly reconstruct the original source code, and as such, will frequently produce _obfuscated code_.

- **delimiter**: A character or sequence of characters marking the beginning or end of a unit of data.

- **Esc** key: named Escape key in the international standard series ISO/IEC 9995.

- **fallback**: A mechanism for carrying forth programmed instructions despite malfunction or failure of the primary device.

- **interface**:
  - The point of interaction or communication between a computer and any other entity, such as a printer or human operator.

  - The layout of an application's graphic or textual controls in conjunction with the way the application responds to user activity

- **interpreter**: A program that translates an instruction into a machine language and executes it before proceeding to the next instruction.

- **macro(s)**:
  - A single, user-defined command that is part of an application and executes a series of commands.
  - A shorthand representation for a number of lines of code.

- **metadata**: data that provides information about other data.

- **mixin**: (In oop) a class that contains methods for use by other classes without having to be the parent class of those other classes.

- a **monochromic** image is composed of one color.

- **parse**: To analyze or separate (input, for example) into more easily processed components.

- **peripheral**: An auxiliary device, such as a printer, modem, or storage system, that works in conjunction with a computer.

- **polyfill**: A plugin that provides the functionality of newer browsers to older versions.

- **register**: A part of the central processing unit used as a storage location.

- **regular expression**: A text string that describe patterns to find text or positions within a body of text.

- **scheme** (綱要) refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed (divided into tables in the case of relational database).

- **serialization** is converting object into json string.

- **thumbnail**: A reduced image of a graphic or document page, used in order to view multiple images on a screen simultaneously or to download such images more rapidly.
